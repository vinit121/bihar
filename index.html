                           Even, Buddha is said to have delivered lectures near the mango grove in Nalanda.
                           The fame of this education centre was to an extent that Hieun Tsang, the famous Chinese traveller visited here and stayed for atleast two years here. 
                           Even, I-tsing another famous Chinese voyager stayed at Nalanda for about 10 years, AND such was the glory of this place.
                           Today most parts of Nalanda lie in ruins but the place is surely worth exploring!
